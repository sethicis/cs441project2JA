Multi line declarations and multi line assignmnents works.
do-while and repeat until works.
C / C++ style variable declarations.

NOTE WORKING: Right now our code can only output integer values.
The scanner and parser properly identify doubles, and ints but
we cannot output doubles or properly perform operations on them.

This is a cs441 project for modifying a pascal like calculator.
